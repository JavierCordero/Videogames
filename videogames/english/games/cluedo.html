							<p> In this case we have a project for the Artificial Intelligence course in which we created two artificial intelligences to play alongside a human player. <br> <br>

							These two AI's are represented by B1 and B2, while the player is H0. The player will be able to perform the typical movements of the cluedo (move, deduct or blame), with the consequences that each of these actions brings. One of the artificial intelligences will have an advanced intelligence system while the other will be "dumb" AI. <br> <br>

							At the beginning of each game the cards are distributed to each of the entities that participate with a stay, and these are marked on the card of each player which we can see at all times.
							<br>

							In this tab, we can find both our tab and that of the bots, as well as the mix of the three to see what the solution of the game is. <br> <br>

							As the game progresses, the AI ​​will make assumptions and record the result on its counter. To give an example, if the intelligent AI asks for the object X to the human player and he has it, he will point it and also point out that the other two do not have it. It will also make more complex assumptions such as asking a player if he has one of the three cards (stay, suspect and weapon) and if he has one of them, he doubts if he can have the others. </p>
